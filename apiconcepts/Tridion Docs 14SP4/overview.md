[Development prerequisites](https://docs.rws.com/784837/720093/sdl-digital-experience-accelerator-2-2/development-prerequisites)
Developing custom Tridion Sites web applications/sites requires a full development environment. The necessary third-party software differs depending on whether you are developing a .NET or Java application.

Set up a .NET development environment to customize or extend the DXA .NET web application.

[Java web application development](https://docs.rws.com/784837/720545/sdl-digital-experience-accelerator-2-2/java-web-application-development)
Set up a Java development environment to customize or extend the DXA Java web application.

[Using SDL's public APIs](https://docs.rws.com/784837/679912/sdl-digital-experience-accelerator-2-2/using-sdl-s-public-apis)
