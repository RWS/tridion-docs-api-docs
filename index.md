# Welcome to the Tridion Docs API documentation.

Here youâ€™ll find all the information you need to get started developing against your own instance of Tridion Docs. Discover quick guides explaining how to build, develop and deploy your app, plus hints and tips to help you make the most of our APIs.

Should you have any ideas as to how we can improve this documentation, any new topics you think we should include or hints and tips you would like to share with the developer community, please let us know.

To let us know what your suggested improvements are you can do this by using the "**Improve this Doc**" link on the top right of every page.  You will need your own github account for this because this action will create a fork of the repository in your account where you can make the changes and then submit a pull request for us to review and accept.
